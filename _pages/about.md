#🎊 Welcome to my website!

I am currently a Research Assistant (RA) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech, China) under the supervison of [Prof. Qiang Zhu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/zhuq/en/) and [Prof. Xiaogang Hu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/huxg/en/). I am interested in **Additive Manufacturing**, **Microstructure Characterization**, and **Mechanical Properties**. I love to collaborate and work with different people on multi-disciplinary projects. And from extensive course work, I have built up a solid background in metal additive manufacturing.

My master thesis invovles the effects of post heat treatments on anisotropic mechanical properties of Inconel 718 superalloy manufactured by laser powder bed fusion and laser directed energy deposition. I just passed my thesis defense, and I am preparing to get this work published now.

I received my Bachelor’s degree from SUSTech, in 2019 with my major in Mechanical Engineering. During this period, I worked on the design of fuel cell system for drones in Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Hydrogen Energy with [Prof. Haijiang Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/wanghj/en/).

Please find my [CV](./docs/CV.pdf) here for more about my research projects and background. And please feel free to contact me for any questions or opportunities. 


<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision.
